# Artificial Neural Network implementation
Python implementation of the ANN (artificial neural network) architecture.

This code is aimed to be for educational purposes.

This Jupyter Notebook provides a Python implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture. The purpose of this implementation is to serve as an educational resource for anyone interested in understanding how ANNs work and how they can be implemented in Python, taking into account the specific parts in which I struggled.

The implementation includes the necessary components for building a feedforward neural network, including input, hidden, and output layers. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm with stochastic gradient descent.

The implementation also includes a range of options for customizing the network, including the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the activation function used for each neuron, and the learning rate used in the backpropagation algorithm.

Overall, this Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive and customizable implementation of an ANN architecture that can be used to develop a better understanding of how ANNs work and how they can be applied in a wide range of contexts.
